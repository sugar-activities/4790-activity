# PyCut

PyCut is a pizza-making puzzle game made for the IGME-582 final project at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu). This game teaches basic units of measure to children inspired by the Pizza Pass minigame of *[Logical Journey of the Zoombinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombinis)* (1996).
